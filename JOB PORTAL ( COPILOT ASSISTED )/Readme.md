##  Project Improvement & AI Assistance

This version of the Job Portal represents an **improved and refined implementation** of my work.

* The website structure, layout flow, and page navigation were **designed and improved by me**
* UI consistency, spacing, and responsiveness were **manually enhanced**
* **GitHub Copilot was used in a limited manner** for:

  * Syntax suggestions
  * Minor layout assistance
  * Faster iteration during development

All **core development, customization, and improvements** were performed independently by me.
